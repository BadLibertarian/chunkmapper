Chunkmapper generates the real world in Minecraft.  Start anywhere you want and go as far as you want - the world is completely unbounded.  Chunkmapper maps are large: one block is 30 metres in real life.  At this scale a trip around the world is 1.3 million blocks.

Chunkmapper includes many terrain types and man made features.  The world's railways are mapped with powered tracks including bridges and tunnels.

Chunkmapper is a standalone program, not a Minecraft mod.  Run it while you play Minecraft and it will generate the the world as you go.
