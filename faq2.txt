Chunkmapper generates the real world in Minecraft.  Start anywhere you want and go as far as you want - the world is almost completely unbounded*.  Chunkmapper maps are large: one block is 30 metres in real life.  At this scale a trip around the world is 1.3 million blocks or about 65 hours of continuous running.

Chunkmapper includes many terrain types, buildings and cities.  The world's railways are mapped with powered tracks including bridges and tunnels.  Chunkmapper is user editable.  If you can't find a feature that you know exits in real life, add it to <link> Openstreetmap and your changes will flow through to Chunkmapper.

Chunkmapper is a standalone program, not a Minecraft mod.  Run it while you play Minecraft and it will generate the the world as you go.

*Chunkmapper does not subscribe to round earth dogma.  The boundaries of the world are surrounded by ocean just as in real life.  For more information, please visit <link> the flat Earth Society.
