1)mvn clean install
2)mkdir -p target/inspect
3)cd target/inspect
4)unzip ../chunkmapper2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
NB: The name may accidently be unobfuscated if this version is necessary


NB!!! Looks like this is outdated.  Just use the existing build.xml and DO NOT OVERWRITE IT!!!
5)Open project in Eclipse and try running com.chunkmapper.gui.Main.  Java will complain about missing classpath entry.  You may need to convert to maven project.
6)Run Configurations -> Classpath -> Add gluegen-rt.jar, jogl-all.jar, gluegen & jogl natives.
Order seems to be important: chunkmapper, jogl-all.jar, gluegen-rt.jar, maven-deps, runtime natives.
7)Clean and rerun.  Should be sucessful.
8)Export above run configuration, including build.xml.  Package required libraries into generated JAR.
9)Open build.xml and delete maven references to jogl-all and gluegen-rt (but retain runtime references).  Also delete <fileset> reference to chunkmapper classes
10)Add
<fileset dir="/Users/matthewmolloy/workspace/chunkmapper/target/inspect"/>
<fileset dir="/Users/matthewmolloy/workspace/chunkmapper/chunkmapperResources"/>
11)Add extra build task
<target name="exe" depends="create_run_jar">
	<taskdef name="launch4j" classname="net.sf.launch4j.ant.Launch4jTask" classpath="launch4j.jar:xstream.jar" />
	<launch4j configFile="launch4j.xml" />
</target>
END NB!!!
