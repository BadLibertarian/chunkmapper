This project was previously closed source and available @ http://chunkmapper.com/ for a fee.

It has since been open sourced, https://github.com/whamtet/chunkmapper , and the license is now more permissive than before.

Most importantly, modifications to the source are allowed now.

I am still in discussions with the original author to determine what license he would like the project covered under.
